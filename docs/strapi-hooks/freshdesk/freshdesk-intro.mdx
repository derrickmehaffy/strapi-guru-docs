## About

This hook allows you to use [Freshdesk](https://www.freshdesk.com/) as a service in [Strapi](https://github.com/strapi/strapi) `strapi.services.freshdesk`. Freshdesk is a ticket management software for supporting customers and clients, it allows you to create and manage companies, contacts, and tickets as well as having a customer portal where you can write support articles, FAQs, and run a forum for your customers.

This hook is using the `freshdesk-api` package, for additional information please see their package [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/freshdesk-api). This hook does use [bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird) to switch from callbacks to promise based functions. However it does expose the raw `client` if you wish to use callbacks instead, though that usage is not directly supported.

:::caution
Please note this hook is still a work in progress and should not be used for production.
